# Adaptive-Dropout
In this repository I try to recreate the Adaptive Dropout algorithm for Convolutional Neural Nets.
Machine Learning Library used is PyTorch.
The original paper uses Adaptive Dropout for training Auto Encoders, here we have used it for the 
purpose of training an image classifier.
